# Responsiveness testing

Website has been thoroughly tested for responsiveness on a wide range of devices to ensure a seamless user experience, no matter how our visitors access the site.

PLACEHOLDER

# Browser compatibility testing

All templates listed in [Responsiveness testing](#responsiveness-testing) have been displayed on different browsers with various viewport size.

Following browsers were checked:

- Google Chrome,
- Safari,
- Firefox,
- Brave,
- Microsoft Edge

No errors have been found in displaying layouts, style and functionalities.

# HTML Validation

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) has been used to validate html files, also W3C Web Validator VSC extension was used throughtout development to mark and elimanate errors. For pages that require authentication I used "validate by direct input" method with source code.

PLACEHOLDER

# CSS Validation

The [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) has been used to validate custom CSS through direct code input. Main app stylesheet and module stylesheets for each components have been tested, no errors found. CSS formatter was used in the IDE during development.

![CSS Jigsaw](docs/img/validation_css.png)

# JavaScript Validation

JavaScript files were validated using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) that was installed and configured in IDE.

- all quotes have been changed to double quotes
- single quotes that were apostrophe in the text were escaped with \&apos;
- error: Do not pass children as props. Instead, nest children between the opening and closing tags when i add this part "children={}" was omitet as the fragment of code was as in "Moments" walkthroug project and this is common warning
- react import was added in some files as error wash shown "React must be in scope when using JSX".
- "class" attribute has been used incorrectly instead of "className" in couple of files, it have been corrected.
- there were no more errors as syntax was also checked in IDE and React compiler during development.
- ESlint has been uninstalled after validation and dependencies were removed from package.json
