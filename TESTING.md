# Responsiveness testing

# Browser compatibility testing

All templates listed in [Responsiveness testing](#responsiveness-testing) have been displayed on different browsers with various viewport size.

Following browsers were checked:

- Google Chrome,
- Safari,
- Firefox,
- Brave,
- Microsoft Edge

No errors have been found in displaying layouts, style and functionalities.

# HTML Validation

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) has been used to validate html files, also W3C Web Validator VSC extension was used throughtout development to mark and elimanate errors. For pages that require authentication I used "validate by direct input" method with source code.




# CSS Validation

The [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) has been used to validate custom CSS through direct code input, no errors found.



# JavaScript Validation

JavaScript files were validated using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) that was installed and configured in IDE.

- all quotes have been changed to double quotes
- single quotes that were apostrophe in the text were escaped with \&apos;
- error: Do not pass children as props. Instead, nest children between the opening and closing tags when i add this part "children={}" was omitet as the fragment of code was as in "Moments" walkthroug project.
- react import was added in some files as error wash shown "React must be in scope when using JSX".
- "class" attribute has been used incorrectly instead of "className" in couple of files, it have been corrected.
- there were no more errors as syntax was also checked in IDE and React compiler.
